        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I’m someone who’s always looking to learn, grow, and challenge myself. 
            I enjoy balancing focus and creativity, whether that’s through work, school, or personal interests. 
            I value consistency, self-improvement, and showing up with a good attitude, even when things get busy. 
            I’m driven by curiosity and motivated by progress, and 
            I’m always open to new experiences that help me become better than I was yesterday.
